### Welcome to Zlabs Research Group!

                        We see it all around campus and in statistics.
                        ZettelGeist is a plaintext note-taking system, 
                        inspired by the ZettelKasten Method.
                    

                        The project founders have both been interested in taking notes
                        long before discovering ZettelKasten. We really like the thought 
                        process behind ZettelKasten, however, and think it is ahead of its
                        time by being “less is more” in its focus.

                   
                        ZettelGeist is aimed at supporting the spirit of ZettelKasten,
                        while ensuring that it will be useful in other domains.
                        Our primary audience is the scholar who wants to write notes 
                        using a simple text editor and storing these notes in the 
                        cloud, e.g. in Dropbox, GitHub, etc. While we’d love to build 
                        something like the successor to Evernote or OneNote–even as a graphical
                        client–our view is that no such tool should be developed without having
                        the right core abstractions in place.
                        Ultimately, the note is the central abstraction.
                        Having support for metadata is crucial,
                        especially for scholarly–or other serious–projects.
