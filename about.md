A note is nothing more than a YAML document. Please note that, hereafter, we may use the terms notes, cards, and zettels rather interchangeably. We’ve used other systems and sometimes find ourselves using the terminology rather freely.

When we use the term note, please keep in mind that the term as we see it is interchangeable with index cards, cards, or zettels. So regardless of what terminlology you prefer, we welcome you!

Anyway, the idea of notetaking is to keep it simple, so a note should make no assumptions about formatting whatsoever. In our view of the world, we should be able to introduce other fields but are hopeful that we have identified most of the important ones.

In our current thinking, we have the following sections:

title: an optional title (string)
tags: one or more keywords (list of string)
mentions: one or more mentions (list of string)
dates: a year (string) and era (string) as a nested dictionary
bibtex, ris, or inline (string)
url (string)
bibkey (string)
cite: a bibkey (from same or another zettel) and a page number (or range of page numbers)
summary: (string) - concise summary of the note (by convention)
note (string) - details, usually the text you are wanting to cite
comment (string) - any comment you want to make about the zettel in general
In most situations, freeform text is permitted. In some situations, you will need to put quotes around the text, especially if you are using reserved YAML characters.

These all are intended to be string data, so there are no restrictions on what can be in any field; however, we will likely limit tags, mentions, dates in some way as we go forward. Fields such as bibtex, ris, or inline are also subject to validity checking.

Here’s an example where of a zettel where most fields are being used.

title: First BIB Note for Castells

comment: This is my first zettel but my comments have nothing to do with the note itself.
summary: Lorem ipsum rocks. This is a summary of what you see in the note field.
