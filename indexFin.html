ZettelGeist is a plaintext note-taking system, inspired by the ZettelKasten Method. The project founders have both been interested in taking notes long before discovering ZettelKasten. We really like the thought process behind ZettelKasten, however, and think it is ahead of its time by being “less is more” in its focus.</p> <br/> <p> ZettelGeist is aimed at supporting the spirit of ZettelKasten, while ensuring that it will be useful in other domains. Our primary audience is the scholar who wants to write notes using a simple text editor and storing these notes in the cloud, e.g. in Dropbox, GitHub, etc. While we’d love to build something like the successor to Evernote or OneNote–even as a graphical client–our view is that no such tool should be developed without having the right core abstractions in place. Ultimately, the note is the central abstraction. Having support for metadata is crucial, especially for scholarly–or other serious–projects.</p></h4> <!-- <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}" class="read-more">Read More</a> NOT NEEDED, WE WANT ALL POSTS DISPLAYED FULLY AT THIS POINT--> </article> {% endfor %} </div>
